    A third person was charged Thursday by special counsel Jack Smith in the classified
    documents case against former President Trump, according to court filings.
    
    Driving the news: Carlos de Oliveira, 56, of Palm Beach Gardens, Florida, 
    was added to the obstruction conspiracy charge in the original indictment.
    
    The superseding indictment also charges the former president, De Oliveira 
    and Trump aide Waltine Nauta with two new obstruction counts
     "based on allegations that the defendants attempted to delete surveillance 
     video footage at The Mar-a-Lago Club in summer 2022," per the court documents.
    Oliveira was a maintenance worker at Mar-a-Lago, according to the documents.
    Of note: An additional retention charge involves audio released by CNN last month 
    in which Trump discussed sensitive documents during a 2021 meeting in Bedminster, New Jersey.
    
    What they're saying: Trump's campaign responded to the superseding 
    indictment by issuing a statement complaining that it marked the 
    Justice Department's continued harassment of 
    the former president and those around him.
    
    Where it stands: Florida District Judge Aileen Cannon last week 
    set the trial date in the classified documents case for May 20.
    
    The big picture: Trump now faces 40 criminal counts related to his 
    alleged efforts to retain classified information after he left the 
    White House and obstruction of justice.
    
    He also faces several other investigations as he campaigns for 
    president, including the probe into his alleged efforts to interfere 
    with the peaceful transfer of power during the 2020 election.
    Meanwhile, Trump's lawyers met with prosecutors earlier Thursday 
    regarding another possible criminal indictment by Smith's office.</pre>

 — 
Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell plans to serve the rest of the 118th
 Congress as the GOP leader, the Kentucky Republican’s office said in a statement Friday.

Questions about the future of McConnell, 81, were swiftly raised this week 
after he froze for 30 seconds during a news conference. 
The statement doesn’t address his plans in the next Congress, 
which begins in 2025.

McConnell suffered a concussion and broken ribs from a fall he endured 
earlier this year.
 He was hospitalized and forced to go to rehab for several weeks 
 before returning to the Senate in the spring. Following the news 
 conference on Wednesday, CNN reported that McConnell has also suffered 
 two other falls this year, according to multiple people familiar with the matter.

McConnell declined to explain why he paused and left his news conference, 
though an aide said he was feeling light-headed.

“I'm fine,” McConnell told reporters when asked about the incident.

This year, McConnell broke the record for 
longest-serving Senate party leader in history, leading the 
chamber’s Republicans since 2007.
